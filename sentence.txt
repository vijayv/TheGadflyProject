Let’s say computers come for most of our jobs.
It has also gained support among a cadre of venture capitalists in New York and Silicon Valley, the people most familiar with the potential for technology to alter modern work.
Andrew L. Stern, a former president of the Service Employees International Union, who is working on a book about U.B.I., compared the feeling of the current anxiety around jobs to a time of war.

It doesn’t help that you have some investors who’ve been terrifically tin-eared about the perils of globalization and the modern economy ( see musings from Paul Graham on inequality, Marc Andreessen on colonialism and Thomas J. Perkins on class resentment. )
“I grew up during the Vietnam War, and my parents were antiwar for one reason : I could be drafted, ” he said.
Though it has enjoyed recognition among wonks and some political momentum in Europe, not a single American presidential candidate has expressed even passing interest in the idea.
Doctors, lawyers, business executives and even technology columnists for The New York Times will have seen their ranks thinned by charming, attractive, all-knowing algorithms.
Now we’re talking about more than just a tweak to the economy — it’s as foundational a departure as when we went from an agrarian society to an industrial one.”
The firm has received thousands of applications for research funding, Mr. Altman said ; it plans to select winning recipients within a few weeks, and ultimately Y Combinator plans to spend “tens of millions” of dollars on research to answer some of the most basic questions about life under U.B.I.
Instead they see automation and U.B.I.
“I think it’s a bad use of a human to spend 20 years of their life driving a truck back and forth across the United States, ” Mr. Wenger said.

Today, as people across all income levels become increasingly worried about how they and their children will survive in tech-infatuated America, “we are back to the Vietnam War when it comes to jobs, ” Mr. Stern said.
In Robot America, most manual laborers will have been replaced by herculean bots.
“People have been predicting that jobs would go away for a long time, and usually what happens is they just change, ” Mr. Altman said.

There is an urgency to the techies’ interest in U.B.I.
Andrew L. Stern, a former president of the Service Employees International Union, who is working on a book about U.B.I., compared the feeling of the current anxiety around jobs to a time of war.
“There’s a sense that growing inequality is intractable, and that we need to do something about it, ” said Natalie Foster, the co-founder of Peers, an organization that supports sharing-economy workers.
Today, as people across all income levels become increasingly worried about how they and their children will survive in tech-infatuated America, “we are back to the Vietnam War when it comes to jobs, ” Mr. Stern said.
“All of a sudden people are looking at these trends and realizing these questions about the future of work are more real and immediate than they guessed, ” said Roy Bahat, the head of Bloomberg Beta, the venture capital firm funded by Bloomberg L.P.
Even where technology has created more jobs, like the so-called gig economy work created by services like Uber, it has only added to our collective uncertainty about the future of work.
“We’re talking about divorcing your basic needs from the need to work, ” said Albert Wenger, a venture capitalist at Union Square Ventures, a proponent who is working on a book about U.B.I.
Imagine the government sending each adult about $ 1,000 a month, about enough to cover housing, food, health care and other basic needs for many Americans.
The most idealistic thinkers see the plan as a way to foster the sort of quasi-utopian future we’ve only encountered in science fiction universes like that of “Star Trek.” As computers perform more of our work, we’d all be free to become artists, scholars, entrepreneurs or otherwise engage our passions in a society no longer centered on the drudgery of daily labor.
But even so, “during those periods of change, things can be quite disruptive, ” and at the very least, U.B.I.
Rather than a job-killing catastrophe, tech supporters of U.B.I.
Mr. Altman said these questions range from the most practical — how much U.B.I.
Truck drivers, cabbies, delivery workers and airline pilots will have been superseded by vehicles that do it all.
Though the macroeconomic statistics suggest the United States has recovered from the last recession — job growth in 2015 reached levels not seen since the 1990s — surveys show that many Americans feel vulnerable and anxious about their jobs and finances.

But for the sake of argument, imagine that within two or three decades we’ll have morphed into the Robotic States of America.
Their plan is known as “universal basic income, ” or U.B.I., and it goes like this : As the jobs dry up because of the spread of artificial intelligence, why not just give everyone a paycheck?

Speaking at the annual RSA Conference, Secretary Carter sought common ground with companies worried by Apple’s fight with the Federal Bureau of Investigation over access to an iPhone.
SAN FRANCISCO — Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter assured an audience of computer security experts Wednesday that he was not in favor of a “back door” that would give the government access to data that is protected by encryption.
“Just to cut to the chase, I’m not a believer in back doors or a single technical approach, ” Secretary Carter said to loud applause during a panel discussion at the conference.
If Silicon Valley and Washington can not find some alternative solution through innovation, Secretary Carter added, the most likely result would be a poorly written law, “or a solution written by China or Russia.”

Also on Wednesday, Secretary Carter said Alphabet’s executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, would head a new Defense Innovation Board to help connect tech companies and entrepreneurs with various Pentagon initiatives.
People in the tech industry worry, however, that the request for help in the San Bernardino case is merely a prelude and point to a number of other pending cases in which law enforcement authorities would like Apple’s assistance.
“I don’t think we ought to let one case drive a single solution, ” Secretary Carter said, referring to the F.B.I.-Apple dispute.
Secretary Carter’s comments, though short on specifics, highlight the challenges various government agencies will face as they seek cooperation from Silicon Valley as the court fight between Apple and F.B.I.

While the German investigation will look into Facebook’s digital practices, it remains unclear whether other European policy makers — including at the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union — will also open antitrust inquiries into the social network.

BRUSSELS — Facebook became the latest American technology company on Wednesday to face antitrust hurdles in Europe after the German competition authority opened an investigation into whether the company has abused its dominant position in social networking.
This year, for example, Margrethe Vestager, the European competition commissioner, said the collection of a vast amount of users’ data by a small number of tech companies like Google and Facebook could violate of the region’s tough competition rules.
“Dominant companies are subject to special obligations, ” Andreas Mundt, president of the German competition authority, said in a statement on Wednesday.
The announcement on Wednesday, however, represents the latest in a growing number of regulatory challenges that Facebook is facing across the European Union, one of the company’s most important areas of operation.
“Dominant companies are subject to special obligations, ” Andreas Mundt, president of the German competition authority, said in a statement on Wednesday.
“For advertising-financed Internet services such as Facebook, user data are hugely important.”
“If a few companies control the data you need to cut costs, then you give them the power to drive others out of the market, ” Ms. Vestager said.
The move puts Facebook, which is used by many of Europe’s 500 million citizens, alongside other United States technology companies, like Google and Microsoft, which have also faced antitrust investigations into their activities across the region.

German authorities have long battled with Facebook and other United States digital companies over their differing interpretations of what constitutes a violation of privacy in the digital age.
Facebook held discussions with European antitrust officials over its acquisition of the WhatsApp messaging service in 2014, but the German investigation is the first competition inquiry the company has faced in the region.
That led to senior European judges invalidating the so-called safe harbor data-transfer agreement between the two regions, increasing uncertainty over how companies like Facebook could move data across the Atlantic.
“We look forward to working with the Federal Cartel Office to answer their questions, ” the company said in a statement.
In an acknowledgment of the growing regulatory challenges now confronting Facebook in Europe, Mark Zuckerberg, the company’s 31-year-old chief executive, traveled to Germany last month to meet with policy makers, local publishers and the company’s users.
In response, Facebook said it was confident that it had complied with German law.

For Facebook, whose business model is based on selling advertisements targeted at users based on information in their posts, the company’s use of people’s digital data is increasingly putting it at odds with Europe’s tough data protection rules, which view individuals’ privacy rights on a par with rights such as the freedom of expression.
Facebook held discussions with European antitrust officials over its acquisition of the WhatsApp messaging service in 2014, but the German investigation is the first competition inquiry the company has faced in the region.
This week, a separate German court fined Facebook $ 110,000 — a small amount for a company that generates billions of dollars each year — for not sufficiently informing its users how the company would use content posted on the social network.
This year, for example, Margrethe Vestager, the European competition commissioner, said the collection of a vast amount of users’ data by a small number of tech companies like Google and Facebook could violate of the region’s tough competition rules.

On Tuesday, Apple filed its formal objection to the government order to open up the iPhone, citing the reasons set forth in a previously filed motion.
A federal magistrate judge in a separate drug case in New York ruled against a government request to extract data from an iPhone, a decision that could influence the San Bernardino case.
Silicon Valley’s arc in supporting Apple — an initial flurry of concerns followed by an eventual coming around to the idea — is epitomized by Max Levchin, the co-founder of PayPal and chief executive of Affirm, an online financial services firm.
On Monday, Apple got good news that could help soothe lingering tech industry doubts about its defense in the San Bernardino case.
Silicon Valley’s arc in supporting Apple — an initial flurry of concerns followed by an eventual coming around to the idea — is epitomized by Max Levchin, the co-founder of PayPal and chief executive of Affirm, an online financial services firm.
A report by Pew Research Center last week said 51 percent of Americans believed that Apple should unlock the iPhone to assist the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the case, while only 38 percent found Apple in the right.
Last week in an interview on CBS, Mr. Levchin said his views on the case over the previous several days had shifted from a “clear-cut, black-and-white” stance of helping the F.B.I.
“Given the years of companies’ reluctance to be at the barricades around intelligence discussions, this is significant, ” said Jules Polonetsky, chief executive of the Future of Privacy Forum, an industry-financed think tank in Washington.
On Monday, Apple got good news that could help soothe lingering tech industry doubts about its defense in the San Bernardino case.

A report by Pew Research Center last week said 51 percent of Americans believed that Apple should unlock the iPhone to assist the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the case, while only 38 percent found Apple in the right.
Still, several executives at tech companies supporting Apple said they were worried that Apple had picked a fight that could end up backfiring on the rest of the industry.
“Given the years of companies’ reluctance to be at the barricades around intelligence discussions, this is significant, ” said Jules Polonetsky, chief executive of the Future of Privacy Forum, an industry-financed think tank in Washington.
Keith Rabois, a venture capitalist with the firm Khosla Ventures, said he was a strong believer in privacy and encryption — “all the normal Silicon Valley views, ” he said — but worried that Apple could lose the case, setting a legal precedent that could force other companies to compromise the security of their products for law enforcement.
“Given the years of companies’ reluctance to be at the barricades around intelligence discussions, this is significant, ” said Jules Polonetsky, chief executive of the Future of Privacy Forum, an industry-financed think tank in Washington.
The show of support — including briefs filed on Wednesday by groups like the American Civil Liberties Union and Access Now — is unusual in its breadth, showing that many in Silicon Valley believe that it could have profound implications on the trustworthiness of their products.
For Mr. Rabois and others, the circumstances working against Apple include the iPhone’s connection to a terrorist attack that left 14 people dead, rather than to a less highly charged crime.
Dropbox’s general counsel, Ramsey Homsany, said in a statement, “We stand against the use of broad authorities to undermine the security of a company’s products.”
For many tech companies that were initially concerned by Apple’s opposition to opening up the iPhone in the San Bernardino case, the worries centered not only on whether this was the right case for challenging the government but also on how public perceptions of the fight might reflect on the rest of the industry, according to tech executives involved in the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

In the years since the disclosures by Edward J. Snowden, the former intelligence contractor who released a trove of details on United States government surveillance tactics, some tech companies have been trying to educate members of Congress about online privacy practices.
The proposed commission, the bill for which was introduced on Monday, would be led by the House Homeland Security Committee chairman Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas, and Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia.

Several feared the showdown with the government was too risky and could have far-reaching implications for the tech industry if Apple lost.
In the days since a magistrate judge in California ordered Apple to bypass security measures on the iPhone, lawyers in some of the companies debated these issues with one another and peers at other firms.

Critics of Apple’s approach believe that the company could have quietly complied with the government’s request to help break into the iPhone and then taken a public stand in a more favorable case.

Others were also anxious that Apple’s defiance of the government could lead to congressional efforts to reshape, in ways unfavorable to the tech industry, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, which privacy advocates and tech companies have long claimed needs an overhaul.
About 40 companies and organizations are expected to file court briefs on Thursday backing Apple as it fights a judge’s order to help law enforcement break into an iPhone used by a gunman in the San Bernardino, Calif., terrorist attack last year.
All of the executives asked to remain anonymous because their deliberations were private, but their views are shared among others in Silicon Valley.
Furthermore, the iPhone was owned by the employer of the gunman, Syed Rizwan Farook, which consented to a search of the device.
Dropbox, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Snapchat and Yahoo are among the tech companies expected to sign on to briefs in the case, according to people with knowledge of the plans who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

The proposed commission, the bill for which was introduced on Monday, would be led by the House Homeland Security Committee chairman Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas, and Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia.
Others were also anxious that Apple’s defiance of the government could lead to congressional efforts to reshape, in ways unfavorable to the tech industry, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, which privacy advocates and tech companies have long claimed needs an overhaul.
For many tech companies that were initially concerned by Apple’s opposition to opening up the iPhone in the San Bernardino case, the worries centered not only on whether this was the right case for challenging the government but also on how public perceptions of the fight might reflect on the rest of the industry, according to tech executives involved in the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
About 40 companies and organizations are expected to file court briefs on Thursday backing Apple as it fights a judge’s order to help law enforcement break into an iPhone used by a gunman in the San Bernardino, Calif., terrorist attack last year.
Keith Rabois, a venture capitalist with the firm Khosla Ventures, said he was a strong believer in privacy and encryption — “all the normal Silicon Valley views, ” he said — but worried that Apple could lose the case, setting a legal precedent that could force other companies to compromise the security of their products for law enforcement.
On Monday, Apple got good news that could help soothe lingering tech industry doubts about its defense in the San Bernardino case.
